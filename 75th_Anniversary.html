<h1>75th Anniversary of the arrival of the Salesians of Don Bosco in Glenorchy </h1>
<p>As we celebrate the arrival of the Salesians in Glenorchy 75 years ago, we turn to consider their inspiration and guide Saint John Bosco, who has also become our inspiration and guide here at Dominic. 
  
  We know a lot about Saint John Bosco and his students in the Oratory. We know how he expected his students to study hard and pray reverently as well as have lots of fun together. He was a much-loved teacher and an inspirational preacher. 
  
  He gave the opportunity of an education to disadvantaged children and young people who would not normally have been able to access an education. 
  
  Saint John Bosco however, was also an amazing writer and publisher. Initially, he wrote pamphlets, which were a kind of newsletter, and about twice a month published them for popular reading by Catholics to help keep them true to their faith.
  
  Don Bosco started a printing press of his own and expanded the number of printing presses at the Oratory. Don Bosco’s own students became efficient operators of the printing press as well. 
  
  During his life, Don Bosco published 130 books as well as pamphlets, tracts, almanacs, and plays.  
  
  Three of his publications were cherished by his students as they were written about three wonderful students who attended the Oratory. In 1859, he wrote the Life of Dominic Savio and then three years later he wrote about two other students:  Michael Magone in 1861 and Francis Besucco in1864. 
  
  Because Don Bosco was so busy during the day, most of his writing was done at night and he would sit at a small writing table and write using paper and ink. 
  
  The Salesians have always been good writers, learning to write well and use writing to influence others is a characteristic of the Salesians.

<h1> The Dominic College Song </h1>
<p1>The Dominic College Song made its original debut in 1989. It was written and composed by Helen Harvey, formerly Helen Beha, who began her association with the College in 1976 when her son began Prep. Helen’s journey with the College spanned 14 years as a parent, teacher and friend. 
  
  For the initial 16 years, Dominic College was without a school song. Helen understood the importance of a school song as an anthem of ownership and a means of stating the school’s ethos, traditions and beliefs. She wrote the song to include the patron saints knowing that the song would serve as a bond and a source of pride, hope and patriotism. The exterior brickwork of out Fra Angelico is enhanced with a digital byte from the College Song. 
  
  Since its inception, our school song continues to bond us as a Salesian community bringing together present-day staff, students and families as well as our Old Scholars and our Salesian mentors and guides from across the years. </p1>
